# EUMEL.Dj

A remote DJ application which plays songs on a party and guests can vote on songs to play. The user documentation moved to the
[EUMEL Suite project site](https://eumel-suite.github.io/).


This project was initially planned as a side project for state-of-the-art technologies. This project now a part of the EUMEL Suite and 
a detailed documentation of the users interface can be found there.


The implementation details can be found in a separate [marp](https://marpit.marp.app/)-based [presentation](MARPME.md).
